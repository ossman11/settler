# Project information

here will be the information required to get started with contriburting to the project.

## First steps

Before it will be possible to contribrute to the project it will be required to setup an ```Github``` account. With the ```Github``` account it will be possible to ```fork``` the project. With this fork it will be possible to make any changes to the project without having an impact on the original project. Once certain changes are made to your fork it will be possible to create a ```pull request``` which will have to be approved and merged before the changes will be available to all other contribruters.

1. Create ```Github``` account [here](https://github.com/join)
1. Create fork from repository [here](https://github.com/ossman11/settler)
1. Clone fork and commit changes with ```git``` [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. Create ```pull request``` to make changes global [here](https://github.com/ossman11/settler/pulls)
